## 🚀 Who Am I?

I am a self-taught learner passionate about **Data Science**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **applied mathematics**, and **African philosophy**.  
My ambition is to contribute to a new way of thinking about knowledge in Africa:  
a vision that is rooted, simple, alive, and capable of inspiring real transformation.

I believe technology — especially data — can become a powerful tool to rebuild our institutions, our educational systems, and our relationship with the world.
